## Introduction

My goal with this application was to build a functioning online quiz where users could compete to get the highest score after answering 5 questions. 

## Installation 

N/A

## About

I started by creating the repo and adding/creating files (index.html, highscores.html, index.js, logic.js and css) some of these such as the CSS were already supplied. Here was what the home screen looks like !

I started by defining the quiz data by adding in the 5 questions using 'Let quizData' with the question, choices and correctAnswer defined. 

The timer and time limit was added as variables. 

I then added a function to start the quixz and display the first question as the quiz begins. Alongside this I added in the DOM elements in the index.js and the event listner for the start button and the submit button. 

The function to be able to display the current question and the question title and choices to change with next answer and a alert whether the question was wrong on right is displayed on screen with a delay before moving on. Here is a shot of the alert on screen after a choice was made. - ![Alt text](<assets/images/screenshot1.png>)

Scores were listed and stored in the highscores html and stored locally. Shown here - ![Alt text](<assets/images/screenshot2.png>)

The user now should be able to use the quiz effectively and as asked for, be able to complete the quiz and save their score.
